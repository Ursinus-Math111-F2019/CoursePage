									<h2><a name = "domainrange1">Domain/Range Example 1</a></h2>
									<p>
										<h3>
											<u>Question:</u> 
											<p>
													If \[ f(x) = (64-x^2)^{\frac{5}{2}} \]
													then what is the domain/range of <code>f(x)</code>?
											</p>
										</h3>

										<h3><u>Answer</u></h3>
										<p>
										Note that this is a slightly different example from the one we gave in class today (the upper semicircular arc), but we can reason about it in a similar way.  Recall that \[ a^{\frac{5}{2}} \]  is the same thing as raising <code>a</code> to the fifth power and then taking the square root (the numerator says to which power we take it, and the denominator says to which root).  If <code>a</code> is negative, then <code>a<SUP>5</SUP></code> is also negative, because it has an odd number of negative factors.  Then we would be taking a square root of a negative number, which is undefined in this class.  So in this example, we need that

										\[ 64-x^2 > 0 \]

										or in other words

										\[ x^2 < 64 \]

										This implies that the domain is

										\[ [-8, 8] \]

										including the endpoints +/-8 where the function is zero.  But we can't go less than -8 or more than 8.  
										</p>

										<p>
											Well what about the range?  What's the largest number we can get?  In this case, it turns out to be when we plug in x=0, which is

											\[ (64-0^2)^{\frac{5}{2}} = (64)^{\frac{5}{2}} = 32768 \]

											Also note that the smallest value is 0 at +/- 8 (we can never get a negative from doing a square root).  So the range is

											\[ [0, 32768] \]
										</p>

										<p>
											Just so you can see what the plot looks like, we'll do that in Maple:

										<h3>
											<u>Question:</u> 
											<p>
													If \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{x-4} \]
													then what is the domain/range of <code>f(x)</code>?
											</p>
										</h3>

										<h3><u>Answer</u></h3>
										<p>
											Here we have to be careful because there's a value of <code>x</code> that makes this undefined.  In fact, when <code>x = 4</code>, we end up with <code>1/0</code>, which is invalid.  So the domain cannot include <code>x = 4</code>.  We can write the domain using set notation as

											\[ (-\infty, 4) \cup (4, \infty) \]

											Notice how the domain is up to but excluding 4 on both ends.
										</p>

										<p>
											Well what about the range?  Here's where another interesting thing happens, because we can't actually ever reach zero.  If we let <code>x</code> become a very large positive number, we can get very close to zero from above, but we never reach it.  Similarly, if we let <code>x</code> be a very large negative number, we get very close to zero from below, but we never reach it.  So the range is
											\[ (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) ]

											A plot of this function, which is known as a "hyperbola," is shown below

											<BR>

											As a sneak preview for limits, the line <code>y=0</code> is a "horizontal asymptote" and the line <code>x = 4</code> is a "vertical asymptote"

									<hr><h2><a name = "domainrange3">Domain/Range Example 3</a></h2>
									<p>
										<h3>
											<u>Question:</u> 
											<p>
													If \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{x-4} \]
													then what is the domain of <code>f(f(x))</code>?
											</p>
										</h3>

										<h3><u>Answer</u></h3>
										<p>
											So we start off with the same function as the above example, but we compose it with itself.  The composite function is then

											<h2>
											\[f \circ f (x) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x-4}-4} \]
											</h2>

											If we end up with an undefined value at any point in this expression, then the composition is undefined for that input!  For instance, if <code>x=4</code>, this is still undefined.  Another way to look at this is that it fails to be defined on the first application of <code>f</code>, so we have to stop there (we can't plug an undefined value into the second <code>f</code>).  But there is still one more value that can cause us problems when the denominator of <code>f(f(x))</code> is zero.  To solve for this, we do

											\[ \frac{1}{x-4}-4 \]

											\[ \frac{1}{x-4} = 4 \]

											\[ 4(x-4) = 1 \]

											\[ 4x = 17 \]

											\[ x = 17/4 \]

											So the domain of this function actually excludes both 4 and 17/4, so the final expression for the domain is

											\[ (-\infty, 4) \cup (4, \frac{17}{4}) \cup (\frac{17}{4}, \infty) \]

										</p>

									<hr><h2><a name = "transformation1">Transformation Example 1</a></h2>
									<p>
										<h3><u>Question:</u>
											<p> If
											\[ g(x) = 4f(\frac{x}{2} - 3) + 12 \]
											then what does <code>g(x)</code> to do the graph of <code>f(x)</code>?
										</p>
										</h3>
										<h3><u>Answer:</u></h3>
										Don't forget to go back to the <a href = "https://www.geogebra.org/m/yxa2dw5x">interactive tool</a> if you're having trouble with this example!
										To answer this, we should always go back to the "canonical form" shown in that tool, which is 

										\[ g(x) = a f \left( b(x - h) \right) + k \]

										In this example, the canonical form is

										\[ g(x) = 4f \left( \frac{1}{2} (x - 6) \right) + 12 \]

										Then we recall that 

										<ul>
											<li><code>|a| > 1</code> stretches the function in the y direction by <code>|a|</code>, and <code>|a| < 1</code> compresses the function by a factor of <code>1/|a|</code> in the y direction.  Furthermore, if <code>a < 0</code>, then the graph is also <i>reflected about the x-axis</i> (flipped upside down)</li>

											<li><code>k</code> simply shifts the graph up y by the amount <code>k</code></li>

											<li>The graph is shifed along x by the amount <code>h</code>.  If <code>h</code> is positive, then <code>f(x-h)</code> shifts to the right, and if it is negative, the graph is shifted to the left.</li>

											<li>If <code>|b| < 1</code>, then the graph is stretched out by a factor of <code>1/|b|</code> in the x direction <i>about the line <code>x = h</code></i>.  If <code>|b| > 1</code>, then the graph is compressed by a factor of <code>|b|</code> in the x direction about the line <code>x = h</code>.  If <code>b < 0</code>, the graph is also reflected about the line <code>x = h</code> (flipped horizontally)</li>
										</ul>

										So by referring to the above list, we see that <code>f</code> undergoes the following transformations
										<ol>
											<li>It is scaled vertically by a factor of 4</li>
											<li>It is shifted vertically by 12 units</li>
											<li>It is shifted to the right by 6 units</li>
											<li>It is stretched out by a factor of 2 about the line <code>x = 6</code></li>
										</ol>
									</p>
								<hr><h2><a name = "slope2">Slope Function Example 1</a></h2>
								<p>
										<h3><u>Question:</u>
											<p> If
											\[ f(x) = |3x - 12| \]
											then what is the slope function <code>s(x)</code> of <code>f(x)</code>?
										</p>
										</h3>
										<h3><u>Answer:</u></h3>
										Just to make sure we're on the same page, <code>s(a)</code> gives the slope of <code>f(x)</code> at <code>x = a</code>.  If it wasn't for the absolute value, then this would be a line of slope 3 everywhere.  But the absolute value flips things.  Factoring this will help

										\[ f(x) = |3(x - 4)| \]

										Now we see that 

										\[ f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 3(x - 4) & x > 4 \\ -3(x - 4) & x < -4 \end{array} \right\} \]

										So the slope is actually negative when <code>x < 4</code>.  Therefore, the slope function is

										\[ s(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 3 & x > 4 \\ -3 & x < -4 \end{array} \right\} \]
