                                    As we have shown in class, Maple is a technical computing and documentation software package for mathematics, which you will use to explore some of the concepts we learn in calculus in pairs.  To install Maple on your local machine, you should follow <a href = "../Grossbauer2019_MapleInstall.pdf">these directions</a> (NOTE: You can also access the share drive from <a href = "https://ursinus.okta.com/">Grizzly Gateway</a>).  Please post on Microsoft Teams if you are having issues with the installation.  If all else fails, you should be able to access Maple via a virtual machine on <a href = "https://ursinus.okta.com/">Grizzly Gateway</a>.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Before we get started, it is important to familiarize yourself with the extensive help that is available through Maple.  The Maple Portal has video tutorials on many different aspects of utilizing the software. If you get stuck on something look for Maple help or visit the Maple Portal.  The labs will be designed to walk you step by step <b>but you may need to troubleshoot at times, so use the resource!</b>  Quick ways to get help:

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>From the input prompt line type <code>?command</code>, which will return the help section for that command.  Try it for the <code>solve</code> command which is a very useful algebraic command, ?solve. Maple will return the help pages relating to the solve command.</li>

                                            <li>
                                                Click to activate the window put your cursor over a keyword (ex. <code>solve</code>) and Press F2. Try this method of getting help for the following maple instruction:
                                                <h3>
                                                    <code>
                                                        <i>solve</i>({t<SUP>2</SUP>y<SUP>2</SUP> = 0, t - y = 1, t = 0})

                                                </h3>
                                                You should see the same help pages pop up.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>If all else fails, have a look at <a href = "https://www.math.ubc.ca/~israel/m210/topten.pdf">top 10 mistakes in Maple</a> list to see if you're making one of them!</li>

                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Lab Report Format</h3>

                                        Rather than using Microsoft Word or some other text editor, you will actually be writing your lab reports inside of Maple itself.  Maple has both a <code>Text Mode</code> and a <code>Math Mode</code> that you can switch between when making your reports. You can click back and forth between modes by simply selecting <code>Text</code> (when documenting) and <code>Math</code> (when working math problems) on the tool bar.  This feature will allow you to embed mathematical equations and mathematical work directly in a text document, which would be an absolute pain in Microsoft Word.  Below is a screenshot of how you might format your report.  Circled in red is the toolbar where you can switch between math mode and text mode.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Other Tips</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Maple has both a document and worksheet mode. From the <code>file</code> menu, select <code>new</code> and you will be given the option to select worksheet mode or document mode. The worksheet mode is the more traditional usage of Maple.  However, the document mode produces a bit more elegant documents. Use of the worksheet mode is easier for quick computational work (you can treat it like a souped up calculator at that point), but when you are producing your lab reports, document mode is preferable.  You will notice a difference in command prompts between the two modes.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Save your Maple Worksheet periodically just as you would while working with any document.  Click the file tab and select Save A...so that you can specify the directory that you want to save your work. The files created by Maple will have a <code>.mw </code> extension.  If you want to return to a particular <code>.mw </code> file just double click and Maple will open and populate the worksheet with your work.
                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                           Please be sure to spell check your document.  Much of the functionality that you have with Microsoft Word is available in Maple, so explore Maple's documenting capabilities.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>



                                    <h3>What To Hand In / General Guidelines</h3>

                                    <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        When you are finished all of the steps in the lab and you have written up answers to the associated questions, you should turn in your <code>.mw</code> Maple worksheet that you saved.  Each group will submit exactly one <code>.mw</code> file via Canvas. The title of your electronic version should include both lab partner names & Lab # for ex., “Taylor  Swift and Ella O’Connor Lab #1”.  
                                    </li>
                                    

                                    <li>
                                    You should Answer all questions with complete sentences in Maple. Clearly identify each question.  You will use the text and math modes, as described in this manual, to create a readable document with grammatically correct language.  It is essential to communicate effectively using the appropriate mathematical language.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                    Label all graphs, axes, and explain your plots!
                                    </li>

                                    Add any additional observations and comments that you may have. 
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                    Please make sure that your report is readable to a person not literate in Mathematics.  Someday you will be working in industry or academia, and you will need to effectively communicate your findings to your peers.
                                    </li>

                            When you launch Maple, you start with a blank document with menus and toolbars at the top and palettes on the side.  Explore each of the palettes by expanding them.  At the cursor, you can start typing a math statement.  Press <code>Enter</code> to see the result.  <b>Be sure you are in Math mode</b>.  For example, you should do the following for this lab:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type in <code>3+2 <b>Enter</b></code></li>
                                <li>The result is returned on the next line with a label <code>(1)</code> that increments with each command.  You can access the results to use in other computations by typing <code>Ctrl L</code> and entering the number of the equation label.</li>
                                <li>For lab reporting purposes, it is better to have the answer returned on the same line. Type in <code>3 + 2 Ctrl =</code>.</li>

                                    <p> In Maple, there are two ways to take square roots. The first is to raise an expression to the <code>1/2</code> power by going into <i>exponent mode</i> with the <code>^</code> symbol.  As with fraction mode, you can exit exponent mode by pressing the right arrow.  For example, type <code>25 ^ 1 / 2</code>, followed by the right arrow and <code>Enter</code>.  You should have an output of <code>5</code>.  Alternatively, for square roots in particular, you can use the <code>sqrt()</code> command. For example, type in <code>sqrt(25)</code> and press Enter. You should get an output of <code>5</code> here as well. 
                                    </p>

                                    Multiplication in Maple is done using the <code>*</code> symbol. For example, type in <code>3*2</code> and press <code>Enter</code>. You should receive and output of <code>6</code>. <b>You should always use <code>*</code> to multiply things together</b>, including functions, numbers, constants, and general expressions, to avoid confusion.  <b>It is a very common error to omit this symbol</b>. There are exceptions to this rule, but they lead to confusion for beginners.

                          In addition to fractions, special symbols such as <code>e</code> and <code>π</code> remain as such throughout all calculations.  You can access <code>Pi</code> from the <code>Common Symbols Palette</code> and <code>e</code> from the <code>Expressions Palette</code>.  An alternative way to access these symbols/commands are through Maple's command completion, where you type the first few characters of the symbol and press <code>Esc</code>. Maple returns a list of possible symbols/commands and you select the one that you want from the list.

                                <i>It is important to use a capital letter P here</i>, since Maple will not understand "pi." Typing in <code>evalf(%)</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code> will give you a decimal approximation of 5/6 + π.

                                Old versions of Maple used <code>E</code> for the constant we call "e." This is no longer the case. If you need this constant, type in <code>e := exp(1)</code>, and press <code>Enter</code>. Maple will now understand that the letter <code>e</code> represents the constant "e." What we have done is the following. The command <code>“:=”</code> tells Maple to assign a certain value to the expression on the left-hand side. In this case, we are giving the symbol “e” a value. Namely, we are giving it the value <code>exp(1)</code>, the exponential of 1, or, as we normally write, <code>e</code>. Type in <code>evalf(e)</code>, and press <code>Enter</code> to get a decimal approximation of the constant “e”.  <i>Take note of this decimal value; it may come in handy later in this lab</i>

                                In Maple, you may enter all sorts of expressions with variables having any name you choose. For example, type in <code>f:= (x+2*y)^3</code>; and press <code>Enter</code>. You have now entered the expression \[(x+2y)^3\] and saved it in a variable named <code>f</code>. Type in <code>f</code> and press <code>Enter</code>. Notice that Maple does not automatically expand these expressions for you! Type in <code>expand(f)</code> and press <code>Enter</code>. Maple will now output the expression you gave it, but expanded. Note that this expanded expression is not saved to the variable <code>f</code>. Maple will still think <code>f</code> is the non-expanded expression you gave it. You can save the expanded expression to a variable called <code>g</code> by typing <code>g := expand(f)</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code>. We may also factor expressions using the <code>factor</code> command. Type in <code>factor(g)</code> and press <code>Enter</code> to factor <code>g</code>.<BR>

                                Oftentimes, we want to substitute numbers into our variables. Notice that since <code>f</code> is an expression, we can't simply write something like <code>f(1,2)</code> to substitute values into it. To substitute numbers into an expression, we use the <code>"subs()"</code> command. Type in <code>subs(x=1,y=2,f)</code> and press <code>Enter</code>. You have just told Maple to substitute 1 for <code>x</code> and 2 for <code>y</code> in the expression <code>f</code>. You should have an output of 125. In this case, the command only sets the x=1 and y=2 in the context of this expression, but if we had instead typed in <code>x:=1</code> and pressed <code>Enter</code>, it would have set <code>x</code> to be 1 <i>for the remainder of the worksheet</i>.  This is probably not a good idea, since we often want to use <code>x</code> as a variable in our expressions!

Typing in <code>h(Pi)</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code> will return \[ \pi^2 + 5 \] Typing <code>h(f)</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code> will square the expression <code>f</code> we defined earlier and then add 5 to it! We can get the expression \[ x^2 + 5\] by simply typing <code>h(x)</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code>.

                            Sometimes we want to divide a polynomial by another polynomial that isn't quite a factor, so there will be a remainder left over.  We will now use Maple to perform <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division">polynomial long division</a>, which will be useful in our next lab.  Let's now write some code to divide a polynomial \[ p(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 \] by the polynomial \[ q(x) = x + 2 \]

<code language="python">p(x) := x^2 - 4*x + 5
q(x) := x+2
qu(x) := quo(p(x), q(x), x)

<code language="python">qu(x)

                                    This should output a quotient of \[ x-6 \] and a remainder of <code>17</code>, respectively.  As a sanity check to make sure this is correct, run the multiplication <code>qu(x)*q(x) + rm(x)</code>, and verify that you get <code>x<SUP>2</SUP> - 4x + 5</code> back.<BR><BR>

                            \[ f(h) = (1 + h)^{1/h} \]
                            (If you forget how to do this, have a look at the <a href = "#functions">functions section</a>!).  This function is undefined at zero, since it would involve 1/0 in the expression, but you can still evaluate it very close to zero.  So try plugging in numbers that get closer and closer to zero, and record what you get (you can plug in different numbers on different cells).  <b>Be sure you are evaluating it numerically.</b>
