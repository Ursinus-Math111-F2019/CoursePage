                                <p>
                                    One interesting question one could ask is what is the peak speed Usain bolt reached during his run?  We know that his average speed is <b>100m/9.58 seconds ~= 10.44 meters/second</b> (about 23 miles per hour!).  However, he had to start from a speed of zero and work his way up, so his peak speed is certainly above this.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To determine his peak speed, we would need to compute a derivative, which requires a differentiable function, but we only have a table of numbers at different intervals.  This isn't even continuous, let alone differentiable! (See below)
                                </p>  

                                <img src = "BoltStem.svg">
                                
                                <p>
                                To get around this, we should fit a function to the data we have.  Simply connecting each dot with a line segment (also known as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">piecewise linear function</a>) won't quite do the trick, though, because the left and right hand derivatives at the recorded times won't necessarily agree, as shown below
                                </p>

                                <img src = "BoltPiecewiseLinear.svg">

                                <p>
                                    A better choice is something known as a <a href = "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicSpline.html">cubic spline</a>, which is a piecewise cubic polynomial <i>whose first and second derivatives agree at the endpoints</i>.  This means that we can meaningfully talk about the velocity <i>and</i> the acceleration at all points in the interval from 0 seconds to 9.58 seconds using a cubic spline.  Maple has a built in function to construct cubic splines in the <code>CurveFitting</code> library.  <a href = "https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=CurveFitting%2FSpline">Click here</a> to see documentation of that function.
                                </p>

                        <p>
                            As an example of building a spline, consider the following code
<pre>
<code language="python">with(CurveFitting)
xs := [0, 1, 4, 5, 6]
ys := [0, 3, 7, -2, 10]
f(x) := Spline(xs, ys, x)
</code>
</pre>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can then plot the spline, and also compute and plot the derivatives using the provided functions up top, as shown below.  <b>You should demonstrate in your notebook that you can reproduce these plots</b>


                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <td><code>plot(f(x), x=0..6)</code></td>
                                    <td><code>plot(diff(f(x), x), x=0..6)</code></td>
                                    <td><code>plot(diff(f(x), x$2), x=0..6)</code></td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td><img src = "SplineExample.png"></td>
                                    <td><img src = "SplineExampleVelocity.png"></td>
                                    <td>
                                        <img src = "SplineExampleAcceleration.png">
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To see what the polynomials actually are, you can simply type <code>Spline(xs, ys, x)</code> in a cell by itself and then click run.  You should roughly get the following on the above example (note that each piece comes with a cubic polynomial and the two numbers that determine the interval over which that polynomial is defined):

                        <h3>
                            \[ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} 0.638x^3 + 2.36x & 0 \leq x < 1 \\ -0.965(x - 1)^3 + 1.92(x - 1)^2 + 4.28x - 1.28 & 1 \leq x < 4 \\ 8.07(x - 4)^3 - 6.77(x - 4)^2 - 10.299x + 48.195 & x \leq 4 < 5 \\ -5.81(x - 5)^3 + 17.443(x - 5)^2 + 0.371x - 3.855 & 5 \leq x < 6\end{array} \right\} \]
                        </h3>
</pre>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, you should be prepared to answer the following questions:

                            <h3>Questions</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Describe the velocity and acceleration plots for Usain Bolt's run over time, using cubic splines to interpolate the data of his splits.  That is, <b>show both the velocity and acceleration plots in your solution, and talk about their overall features</b>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Do you see anything surprising in the velocity/acceleration plots, given that this was the world record?   Where might a track coach be upset with Usain Bolt (i.e. where is there room for improvement, and why do you think this happened)?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    What is the peak velocity that Usain Bolt reached over his run, in meters/second?  Hint: You should narrow this down to one interval by looking at the velocity/acceleration plots.  Then, since the derivative of a cubic is a parabola <b>ax<SUP>2</SUP> + bx + c</b>, you can find the maximum as <b>-b/2a</b> (use Maple to help with evaluating this function as much as possible, rather than doing it by hand).
                                </li>
                            </ol>
