                                <h2><a name = "part1">Problem 1: Root Finding Using The Intermediate Value Theorem (5 pts)</a></h2>
                                    <p>
                                    Consider the equation 

                                    \[ sin(x) + \sqrt{x} = x \]

                                    This equation would be difficult to solve using conventional algebraic means, so we will be instead using a numerical technique that relies on continuity.  To do this, let's hone in on the interval <b>[2, 3]</b> for <b>x</b>.  Since each individual component of this equation is continuous on this interval, each side of the equation is continuous, and the intermediate value theorem holds.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 1: Showing Existence of A Solution on [2, 3]</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    First, re-arrange the above equation into the form <b>f(x) = 0</b>.  Then, define a function in Sage that represents <b>f(x)</b>, evaluate <b>f(x)</b> at the endpoints of the interval, and use the intermediate value theorem to conclude that there must be a solution.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Question:</b>Explain in your writeup how you are applying the intermediate value theorem to conclude that there is a solution in the interval <b>[2, 3]</b>.<BR>
                                        <b>Hint:</b> You may need to numerically evaluate <b>f(2)</b> and <b>f(3)</b> to help you with this.  Look back at the <a href = "../Lab1/sage.html#basicnumerical">previous lab</a> to refresh yourself on how to do this.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 2: Root Finding by Logarithmic Search</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        You will now hone in on the root of <b>f(x)</b> (a solution <b>f(x) = 0</b>), which is also a solution of the above equation, by successively halving the interval under consideration.  Start with a variable <b>a = 2</b> and a variable <b>b = 3</b>.  Then, perform the following steps several times

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Define a variable <b>c</b> that's halfway in between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b></li>

                                            <li>Replace either <b>a</b> or <b>b</b> with the value of <b>c</b>, so that the new <b>f(a)</b> and <b>f(b)</b> continue to have opposite signs.</li>

                                            <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 six more times and indicate in your writeup what your intervals are at each step.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    <b>Hint:</b> The <code>print()</code> command will print out results into your cells, and it can take multiple comma separated values.  For instance, <code>print(1, 2, 3)</code> will output <code>1 2 3 </code>.  This command should help you to keep your notebook organized.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Question: </b> What is the seventh <b>c</b> you get when you do this?  Plug in that <b>c</b> to \[ \sin(x) + \sqrt{x} = x \]
                                        How close is it to satisfying that equation compared to the <b>x = 2</b> and <b>x = 3</b> that you started with?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Extra Credit Question (+2) </b>: How long would it take to get within 0.01 of a true solution of the equation? (Hint: There's a reason this is called logarithmic search).  Are you within that tolerance?
                                    </p>

                        <h2><a name = "part2">Problem 2: Derivatives in Sage (5 pts)</a></h2>
                                <p>
                                    You will now familiarize yourself with the <code>derivative</code> command in Sage.  To take a derivative of an algebraic expression with respect to a variable in that expression, type <code>derivative(expression, variable)</code>.  For instance,
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <code>derivative(x^2 + 3*x, x)</code>
                                </p>

                                should give you <code>2*x + 3</code>.

                                <p>
                                    <b>Question: </b> What is the derivative of 
                                    \[ e^{\sqrt{4x^2 + 2}} \]
                                    with respect to <b>x</b>?  Do this problem by hand and attach your work, then use Sage to show that you got the correct answer.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Consider the function 
        
                                    \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}e^{-x^2/2} \]
        
                                    Compute the first two derivatives by hand and attach your work (taking a picture of writing on paper is fine).  Then check your answers using the derivative function in Sage.  Note that to take the <b>n<SUP>th</SUP></b> derivative of a function <b>f</b> with respect to <b>x</b> in Sage, the command is
    <pre>
    <code language="python">
    fn = derivative(f, x, n)    
    </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Question: </b> Use Sage to compute and plot the 10th derivative, the 50th derivative, and the 100th derivative over the interval from -4 to 4.  What pattern do you notice happening as you compute more and more derivatives?
                                </p>
        
                                <p>
                                    For your general edification, you should know that the polynomials in front of the exponential term at each derivative are known as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials#Definition">Hermite polynomials</a>.  Also, the derivatives are related to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morlet_wavelet">Morlet wavelets</a>, which is a model for how the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex">visual cortex</a> in our brains picks up on edges and stripe patterns.
