                                    One interesting question one could ask is what is the peak speed Usain bolt reached during his run?  We know that his average speed is <b>100m/9.58 seconds ~= 10.44 meters/second</b> (about 23 miles per hour!).  However, he had to start from a speed of zero and work his way up, so his peak speed is certainly above this.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To determine his peak speed, we would need to compute a derivative, which requires a differentiable function, but we only have a table of numbers at different intervals.  This isn't even continuous, let alone differentiable! (See below)
                                </p>  

                                <img src = "BoltStem.svg">
                                
                                <p>
                                To get around this, we should fit a function to the data we have.  Simply connecting each dot with a line segment (also known as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">piecewise linear function</a>) won't quite do the trick, though, because the left and right hand derivatives at the recorded times won't necessarily agree, as shown below
                                </p>

                                <img src = "BoltPiecewiseLinear.svg">

                                <p>
                                    A better choice is something known as a <a href = "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicSpline.html">cubic spline</a>, which is a piecewise cubic polynomial <i>whose first and second derivatives agree at the endpoints</i>.  This means that we can meaningfully talk about the velocity <i>and</i> the acceleration at all points in the interval from 0 seconds to 9.58 seconds using a cubic spline.  Below is some code I have written to compute cubic splines.  Please copy this code into a cell in Sage and execute it.
                                </p>
<pre>
<code language="python">def get_spline_derivative(spline, order):
    return [[derivative(f, x, order), xl, xr] for [f, xl, xr] in spline]

def plot_piecewise(piecewise, color='blue'):
    ps = None
    for [f, xl, xr] in piecewise:
        p = plot(f, (x, xl, xr), color=color)
        if not ps:
            ps = p
        else:
            ps += p
    return ps
    
def zeros_vec(N):
    return vector([0.0]*N)

def get_spline(xs, ys):
    n = len(ys)-1
    a = vector(ys)
    b = zeros_vec(n)
    d = zeros_vec(n)
    h = vector(xs[1::])-vector(xs[0:-1])
    alpha = zeros_vec(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        alpha[i] = 3*(a[i+1]-a[i])/h[i] - 3*(a[i]-a[i-1])/h[i-1]
    c = zeros_vec(n+1)
    l = zeros_vec(n+1)
    mu = zeros_vec(n+1)
    z = zeros_vec(n+1)
    l[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        l[i] = 2*(xs[i+1]-xs[i-1])-h[i-1]*mu[i-1]
        mu[i] = h[i]/l[i]
        z[i] = (alpha[i]-h[i-1]*z[i-1])/l[i]
    l[n] = 1
    for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        c[j] = z[j]-mu[j]*c[j+1]
        b[j] = (a[j+1]-a[j])/h[j] - h[j]*(c[j+1]+2*c[j])/3
        d[j] = (c[j+1]-c[j])/(3*h[j])
    spline = []
    for i in range(n):
        f = a[i] + b[i]*(x-xs[i]) + c[i]*(x-xs[i])^2 + d[i]*(x-xs[i])^3
        spline.append([f, xs[i], xs[i+1]])
    return spline
</code>
</pre>

                        <p>
                            As an example of building a spline, consider the following code
<pre>
<code language="python">xs = [0, 1, 4, 5, 6]
ys = [0, 3, 7, -2, 10]
spline = get_spline(xs, ys)
</code>
</pre>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can then plot the spline, and also compute and plot the derivatives using the provided functions up top, as shown below.  <b>You should demonstrate in your notebook that you can reproduce these plots</b>

                            To see what the polynomials actually are, you can simply type <code>spline</code> in a cell by itself and then click run.  You should get the following on the above example (note that each piece comes with a cubic polynomial and the two numbers that determine the interval over which that polynomial is defined):

                            Now, you should be prepared to answer the following questions:

                            <h3>Questions</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Describe the velocity and acceleration plots for Usain Bolt's run over time, using cubic splines to interpolate the data of his splits.  That is, <b>show both the velocity and acceleration plots in your solution, and talk about their overall features</b>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Do you see anything surprising in the velocity/acceleration plots, given that this was the world record?   Where might a track coach be upset with Usain Bolt (i.e. where is there room for improvement, and why do you think this happened)?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    What is the peak velocity that Usain Bolt reached over his run, in meters/second?  Hint: You should narrow this down to one interval by looking at the velocity/acceleration plots.  Then, since the derivative of a cubic is a parabola <b>ax<SUP>2</SUP> + bx + c</b>, you can find the maximum as <b>-b/2a</b> (use Sage to help with evaluating this function as much as possible, rather than doing it by hand).
                                </li>
                            </ol>
